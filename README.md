# PoE Orb Result Parser
Provides an easy and automated way to log your crafting results in Path of Exile.

---------------------

This autohotkey script is intended to facilitate the documentation of currency usage results.

**This is not a hack and does not use any information that the player could not directly obtain himself.**
It works solely on the data the game writes to the clipboard when you Ctrl+C over an item.

##Currently supported orbs:
* Fusings
* Jewelers
* Chromes

##How to use:
1. Directly before you use your first orb, hover over the item and press Ctrl+N. A confirmation tooltip will appear.
2. After every orb you use, hover over the item and press Ctrl+C. The logged result will be shown.

Any common mistakes should be covered by error messages. Keep in mind though that the tool doesn't know what the item looked like before you used your orb unless you tell it. So if you're fusing 20% quality items, make sure to perform step 1 when the item is 20% quality (and don't change quality between fuses)!

There's also a short <VIDEO LINK> video showing the process in action.

Note: The tooltips will only show up if your Path of Exile is in *Windowed* or *Windowed Fullscreen* mode!


Alteration support might come at some point (anyone is free to contribute though!).
