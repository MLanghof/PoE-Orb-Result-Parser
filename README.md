# PoE Orb Result Parser
Provides an easy and automated way to log your crafting results in Path of Exile. You press Ctrl+C on an item and the item data is automatically parsed and written to a file, according to what orbs you are using.

---------------------

This autohotkey script is intended to facilitate the documentation of, primarily, fusing and alteration results.
It works solely on the data the game writes to the clipboard when you ctrl+c over an item.

Just to be clear: **This is not a hack and does not use any information that the player could not directly obtain himself.** It works completely outside of the game and results in no client input.


The script could easily be extended to provide logging for more kinds of orbs, but that is not currently the focus. Contributions are welcome though.
